# Hazard
Development of General Ontology Design Pattern for Hazard using Earthquake natural hazard and Chemical Spill man-made hazard as use case drivers.

This pattern was presented at the Workshop on Ontology and Semantic Web Patterns (7th edition) -
[WOP2016](http://ontologydesignpatterns.org/wiki/WOP:2016)

The pattern paper [" A Modification to the Hazardous Situation ODP to Support Risk Assessment and Mitigation"](http://ontologydesignpatterns.org/wiki/images/8/80/WOP2016_paper_16.pdf) presents the pattern in more detail.
